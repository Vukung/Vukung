# 👋 Hi, I'm Utkarsh

I'm a final-year B.Tech undergraduate at MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune, with hands-on experience building full-stack web and mobile applications.

I focus on designing backend systems, working with data, and building user-facing features that solve real-world problems — from authentication and payments to real-time updates and clean UI flows.
