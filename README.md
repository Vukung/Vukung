# 👋 Hi, I'm Utkarsh

I'm a final-year B.Tech undergraduate at MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune, with hands-on experience building data-backed applications and backend systems that support real-world decision making.

My work focuses on designing reliable APIs, working with structured and unstructured data, and translating raw data into usable insights — across analytics dashboards, ML pipelines, and production-ready systems.
